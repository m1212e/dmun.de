Nationwide and internationally we are committed in the field of political youth education and Youth Empowerment. Established in 2003, we are accredited to the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a non-governmental organization with special consultative status and to the UNDPI since 2012. We organize political simulation games in which adolescents and young adults between 15 and 21 years experience a United Nations conference. Furthermore, we advocate for political youth education and the participation of young people in political processes on an international level.',
